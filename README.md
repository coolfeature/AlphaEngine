The code presented here relates to the book chapter cited below. There are two implementations of the trading model algorithm:

1. *code.java*:
This class is intended to give an overview of how the trading model algorithm functions. However, the focus lies not on the framework supporting the trading model. As a result, users are required to implement some of their own code in order to get the trading model running.

2. *LimitOrders*:
A folder containing a fully functional version of the Alpha Engine utilizing limit orders.

### Abstract

*We introduce a new approach to algorithmic investment management that yields profitable automated trading strategies. 
This trading model design is the result of a path of investigation that was chosen nearly three decades ago. Back then, 
a paradigm change was proposed for the way time is defined in financial markets, based on intrinsic events. 
This definition lead to the uncovering of a large set of scaling laws. An additional guiding principle was 
found by embedding the trading model construction in an agent-base framework, inspired by the study of complex 
systems. This new approach to designing automated trading algorithms is a parsimonious method for building a new 
type of investment strategy that not only generates profits, but also provides liquidity to financial markets and 
does not have a priori restrictions on the amount of assets that are managed.*
